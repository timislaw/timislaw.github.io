            <h2>About Me?</h2>
            <p>I jumped all over the place before really buckling down on something and deciding that something was going to be Web Development!</p>
            <p>My background includes construction, sales, handi-work, and IT.</p>
            <p>Even though my past shows indecisiveness, I've always had a larger interest in technology and have done everything to stay involved and up-to-speed.</p>
            <h2>Why Web Development</h2>
            <ul class="line-items">
                <li>It is one of the most in-demand roles/careers currently.</li>
                <li>This is a role that is always changing, so it keeps you busy with new languages/subjects to learn.</li>
                <li>This and IT have been the most challenging spaces to get into, so that alone fuels my drive.</li>
                <li>Job security is one of the larger reasons as my past roles were easily replaceable. This helps build worth.</li>
                <li>Allows me to be more entrepreneurial and potentially pursue creating my own web apps.</li>
